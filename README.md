We  havedesigned  a  multi-interfacing  device  that  connects  to  var-ious  common  interfaces  used  for  the  control  of  poweredwheelchairs, such as joysticks, switch-based headarrays, andsip/puff  interfaces.  Our  device  serves  as  a  connection  thatcommunicates signals from the control interface over Blue-tooth,  which  can  then  be  detected  by  any  device  with  theinterface  skills  test  app. 
The  source  code  for  the  device  is  available  athttps://github.com/argallab/WheelchairBLEGamepad.gi
