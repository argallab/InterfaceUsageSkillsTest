## Powered Wheelchair Interface
This app was designed for measuring assistive interface usage skills, specifically powered wheelchair interfaces. Not all powered wheelchairs have Bluetooth connectivity available. We  have designed  a  multi-interfacing  device  that  connects  to  various  common  interfaces  used  for  the  control  of  powered wheelchairs, such as joysticks, switch-based headarrays, and sip/puff  interfaces.  Our  device  serves  as  a  connection  that communicates signals from the control interface over Bluetooth,  which  can  then  be  detected  by  any  device  with  the interface  skills  test  app. 
The  source  code  for  the  device  is  available  [here](https://github.com/argallab/WheelchairBLEGamepad.git).
